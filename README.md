# Probability and Applied Statistics Project 1

This project contains 1 Essay, 1 Formula Sheet, 2 Excel Assignments
and 5 Java programs.
Each individual assignment has its own folder with all relevant files. Some folders have their own README for specifics


## Essay
1. **GitHub Essay:** An overview of why GitHub is important, Git, and how GitHub makes Git more accessible; describes how repositories work and some key words in the process of editing one.  

## Formula Sheet
1. **Formula Sheet (1.0-3.5):** Every textbook formula from Section 1.0 to 3.5 beautifully formatted in a Word document using the Equations feature. 

## Excel Assignments
1. **9/11 Excel Function Practice:** Practice solving for each individual step of standard deviation, including each entry's distance from mean, its square,
the sum of the squares, the variance, and its square root (standard deviation). It also includes Excel's formula function for comparison. 

2. **Relative Frequency Histogram (Textbook pg 6 ex 1.2):** A relative history hisotogram for the wind speeds of 45 different US cities.

## Java Programs:
Each program folder has all relevant files inside, including the java files and whatever is relevant to the output. 

1. **StatsLibrary:** Every textbook equation plus some extras up to Section 3.5 (Geometric Probability Distribution)

2. **Monte Carlo Door Game**: Runs Monte Carlo simulation of the "Price is Right" door game. It produces the probablity of picking the winning door
on the inital try and the probabilities of picking the winning door- after the host reveals a door

3. **Monte Carlo Birthday Game**: Runs Monte Carlo simulation to calcualte the probability that two people have the same birthday in a group of a set size with random birthdays. Users can alter the group size and number of Monte Carlo simulations from the parameters in the plotGameSimulationData(BirthdayGame, int trials). That method also plots the data in excel using Apache POI. 

4. **Monte Carlo Pokemon Game**: Runs 3 Monte Carlo Pokemon simulations. It calculates the probability of having a Pokemon in the opening hand with 1, 2, 3, or 4 Pokemon in the deck, the probability of having at least one Rare Candy in the prize hand ("bricked") given 1, 2, 3, or 4 Rare candies in the deck, and the probability of having 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 Rare Candies in the prize hand when 1, 2, 3, or 4 candies are in the deck.

5. **Functional Pokemon Game**: My best attempt at a Pokemon Trading Card Game
