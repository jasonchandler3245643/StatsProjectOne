This project contains 1 Essay, 1 Formula Sheet, 
and 5 Java programs.
Each individual assignment has its own folder with all relevant files. Some folders have their own README for specifics.

The relevant Apache poi jars used to plot Monte Carlo data in excel have their own folder.


## Essays
1. **GitHub Essay:** An overview of why GitHub is important, Git, and how GitHub makes Git more accessible; describes how repositories work and some key words in the process of editing one.  

## Formula Sheets
1. **Formula Sheet (1.0-3.5):** Every textbook formula from Section 1.0 to 3.5 beautifully formatted in a Word document using the Equations feature. 

## Java Programs:
Each program folder has all relevant files inside, including the java files and screenshots of the output. 

1. **StatsLibrary:** Every textbook equation up to Section 3.5 (Geometric Probability Distribution)

2. **Monte Carlo Door Game**: Runs Monte Carlo simulation to represent picking with versus without revealing a dud door. It contains a Word file with the answers to the textbook question; the answers are also in the main method's comments.

3. **Monte Carlo Birthday Game**: Runs Monte Carlo simulation to calcualte the probability that two people have the same birthday in a group of a set size with random birthdays.

4. **Monte Carlo Pokemon Game**: Runs Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the probability of having a Pokemon in the opening hand with ___ Pokemon in the deck and the probability of having at least one Rare Candy in the prize hand ("bricked") given ___ Rare candies in the deck.

5. **Function Pokemon Game**: A fully functional Pokemon game. 


## Relevant Jars: 
The 9 Apache Poi jars I added to my classpath.
I had trouble figuring out which ones I needed, so I added what the errors told me to until I got an output.
