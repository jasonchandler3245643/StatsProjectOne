# Probability and Applied Statistics Project 1

This project contains 1 Essay, 1 Formula Sheet, 
and 5 Java programs.
Each individual assignment has its own folder with all relevant files. Some folders have their own README for specifics.

The relevant Apache poi jars used to plot Monte Carlo data in excel have their own folder.


## Essay
1. **GitHub Essay:** An overview of why GitHub is important, Git, and how GitHub makes Git more accessible; describes how repositories work and some key words in the process of editing one.  

## Formula Sheet
1. **Formula Sheet (1.0-3.5):** Every textbook formula from Section 1.0 to 3.5 beautifully formatted in a Word document using the Equations feature. 

## Excel Assignment
1. **9/11 Excel Function Practice:** Practice solving for each individual step of standard deviation, including each entry's distance from mean, its square,
the sum of the squares, the variance, and its square root (standard deviation). It also includes Excel's formula function for comparison. 

## Java Programs:
Each program folder has all relevant files inside, including the java files and whatever is relevant to the output. 

1. **StatsLibrary:** Every textbook equation plus some extras up to Section 3.5 (Geometric Probability Distribution)

2. **Monte Carlo Door Game**: Runs Monte Carlo simulation of the "Price is Right" door game. It produces the probablity of picking the winning door
on the inital try and the probabilities of picking the winning door- after the host reveals a door

4. **Monte Carlo Birthday Game**: Runs Monte Carlo simulation to calcualte the probability that two people have the same birthday in a group of a set size with random birthdays.

5. **Monte Carlo Pokemon Game**: Runs Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the probability of having a Pokemon in the opening hand with ___ Pokemon in the deck and the probability of having at least one Rare Candy in the prize hand ("bricked") given ___ Rare candies in the deck.

6. **Function Pokemon Game**: A fully functional Pokemon game. 


## Relevant Jars: 
The 9 Apache Poi jars I added to my classpath.
I had trouble figuring out which ones I needed, so I added what the errors told me to until I got an output.
