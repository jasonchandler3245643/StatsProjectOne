# StatsLibrary

This program contains all of the relevant formulas from textbook sections 1.0 - 3.5
plus some relevant extras like median, mode, and set operations.

There is a main method and a JUnit tester. Both run similar tests, but I wanted to
try working with JUnit. <br>
I used JUnit Jupiter on Eclipse, which added the JARs for me.<br>
