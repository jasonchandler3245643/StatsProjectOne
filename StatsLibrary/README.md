plus some relevant extras like median, mode and set operations.

There is a main method and a JUnit tester. Both run the same tests, but I wanted tp
try working with something new. I used JUnit Jupiter on Eclipse, and it put the JARs there for me.
One of my test, the one for binomial distribution, fails. I am not sure why. I tried fixing it,
but I was unable. It says my expected is .31250 and my actual is .31250. I think it has something to do
with the BigDecimal I am using, but I only used that because that was the only way my method worked.
